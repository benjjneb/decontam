Description: Simple statistical identification of contaminating sequence features in 
    marker-gene or metagenomics data. Works on any kind of feature derived from 
    environmental sequencing data (e.g. ASVs, OTUs, taxonomic groups, MAGs,...).
    Requires DNA quantitation data or sequenced negative control samples.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.4.1),
    methods (>= 3.4.1)
Imports:
    ggplot2 (>= 2.1.0),
    reshape2 (>= 1.4.1),
